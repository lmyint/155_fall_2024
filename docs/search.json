    "text": "Hello, and welcome to a new year at Macalester! I‚Äôm excited to spend the next 15 weeks with you journeying through a beloved field of mine.\nI will confess that early during college, I really didn‚Äôt love statistics. In my first statistics class, we focused almost entirely on formulas and procedures, and I was continually left wondering: ‚ÄúWhy should I care??‚Äù Still, I decided to give statistics another try, and the next year I had the fortune of taking a statistics class that really emphasized the connection between math and data. I began to see and imagine possibilities for collecting data in fields that could improve people‚Äôs lives, and I found this incredibly inspiring.\nIn graduate school, I quickly saw how much other disciplines use and benefit from statistics, and my admiration for the field deepened immensely. I‚Äôve had the chance to use statistics to learn about many interesting areas including biology, epidemiology, public health, and even my own hobbies! Over the years, my students have used data to learn about redlining, renewable energy, cinema, sports, ecology, and so much more.\nI love teaching introductory statistics, and I can‚Äôt wait to show you all the tools and ideas statistics has to offer. I‚Äôm also excited to find ways for you to connect to data and statistics in your own lives.\nLet‚Äôs have a great semester!"

    "text": "My philosophy\nGrading is thorny issue for many educators because of its known negative effects on learning and motivation. Nonetheless, it is ever-present in the US education system and at Macalester. Because I am required to submit grades for this course, it‚Äôs worth me taking a minute to share my philosophy about grading with you.\nWhat excites me about being a teacher is your learning.\nLearning flourishes in an environment where you find meaning and value in what we‚Äôre exploring, feel supported when engaging with challenges, receive useful feedback, and regularly reflect on your learning.\nIf I didn‚Äôt have to give grades, I wouldn‚Äôt. But because I am required to, it is important to me to create a course structure and grading system that allow learning to flourish:\n\nFinding meaning and value: I am striving to achieve this by creating space for authentic connection between you, your peers, and myself and by encouraging you to explore a topic that intrigues you for our course project.\nSupport in engaging with challenges: The assignments and activities that we will use to learn are meant to be challenging, and perfect understanding on your first try is not my expectation. For this reason, there will be opportunities to show improvement in your understanding over time to improve your grade on past assignments and assessments. Strong learning does not occur under excessive stress, so my hope is that having multiple chances to show your understanding alleviates much of the stress that would normally arise from needing to do as well as possible with only one try.\nReceiving useful feedback and reflecting regularly: My aim with feedback is to always provide guidance towards improvement, no matter where you are in your progress. However, good feedback alone is useless‚Äîlearners need to engage deeply with feedback in order to benefit the most from it. For this reason, opportunities to improve your scores on prior assignments will require reflecting on feedback."

For example, if your first attempt on a 1-point question is incorrect, the maximum possible score on that question is 0.67 points for the second attempt. On the third attempt, the maximum score is 0.33 points. No points are awarded for the 4th attempt and beyond.\n\n\nPractice problems\nTo practice concepts that we cover in class, there will be 8 weekly practice problems (PPs) due on Fridays at 5pm. (Note that if needed, extensions are possible‚Äîsee the late work policy.)\nYou will receive qualitative feedback on all questions on these practice problem sets. These assignments will receive on overall score on the following scale:\n\nHigh pass: 2 points\nPass: 1 point\nNeeds improvement: 0 points\n\nShowing growth: If, on a quiz, you demonstrate stronger understanding of the concepts that you missed on a PP, you have the chance to earn a higher score on the PP. Either via email or through an in-person conversation with the instructor, you must discuss how your understanding of the concept(s) changed from the PP to the quiz by addressing feedback from both the PP and the quiz. You can do this 2 times over the semester (once for Quizzes 1 and 2), and you can show improvement on multiple PPs using a single quiz.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be 3 quizzes over the course of the semester.\n\nQuiz 1: Friday, 9/27. 1 hour in class.\nQuiz 2: Friday, 11/1. 1 hour in class. Will cover material from the first quiz to some extent because of the way that material in this course builds on earlier ideas.\nQuiz 3: Monday, 12/16 8:00-10:00am. ~1.25 hours during our final exam slot. Will cover content from the whole course.\n\nEach quiz question will be graded on the following scale:\n\n3 points: fully correct\n2 points: mostly correct with minor errors\n1 point: missing key understanding\n0 points: fully off target or blank\n\nQuiz format:\n\nFully pen/pencil and paper. You will not need to write code or use a calculator, but you will need to be able to read and interpret output from R code.\nYou are allowed to bring a 3x5 index card with notes written on both sides. Typing your notes and pasting them on the card is fine.\n\nShowing growth: For Quizzes 1 and 2, you can earn up to 50% of missed points back on quizzes if you complete a quiz correction and reflection. You must:\n\nWrite a reflection of how you prepared for the quiz and where you felt strongest and more uncertain in your understanding before taking the quiz\nSchedule a meeting with the instructor. During our conversation, you will correct your quiz responses and discuss the above reflection. You will get immediate feedback at this meeting. Use my Calendly page to schedule this meeting.\n\n\n\nProject\nThe goal of the course project is to apply the data analysis skills from our course to investigate a research question in a dataset of your choosing. Through milestones over the course of the semester, you will make steady progress on your projects and iterate on feedback. Full details about the project will be available on the Project page."

Go back to using the bikes dataset (instead of bikes_sub) because we no longer need to only keep days less than 80 degrees.\n\n# Construct and interpret a visualization of this relationship\n# Include a representation of the relationship trend\nggplot(bikes, aes(x = windspeed, y = riders_registered)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n    geom_smooth(color = \"blue\", se = FALSE)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Use lm to construct a model of riders_registered vs windspeed\n# Save this as bike_mod2\nbike_mod2 &lt;- lm(riders_registered ~ windspeed, data = bikes)\n\n# Get a short summary of this model\ncoef(summary(bike_mod2))\n\n              Estimate Std.

(0 is a little below the minimum of the observed data, but not by much! So extrapolation in interpreting the intercept isn‚Äôt a huge concern.)\nSlope: Every 1mph increase in windspeed is associated with a ridership decrease of 65 riders on average.\n\nSee the code below to predict ridership on August 17, 2012 and calculate the corresponding residual. Note that this residual is smaller than the residual from the temperature model (that residual was 3496.731). This indicates that August 17 was more of an outlier in ridership given the temperature than the windspeed.\n\n\nbikes %&gt;% \n    filter(date == \"2012-08-17\") %&gt;% \n    select(riders_registered, windspeed)\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 2\n  riders_registered windspeed\n              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1              5665      15.5\n\n# prediction\n4490.09761 - 65.34145 * 15.50072\n\n[1] 3477.258\n\n# residual \n5665 - 3477.258\n\n[1] 2187.742",

For a single quantitative variable, we can make a boxplot, density plot, or histogram. Let‚Äôs look at a histogram:\n\nggplot(pockets, aes(x = minHeightFront)) +\n    geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you interpret a plot of a quantitative variable, there are 4 aspects to keep in mind:\n\nShape\nCenter\nSpread\nOutliers\n\nShape: How are values distributed along the observed range? What does the distribution of the variable look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter: What is a typical value of the variable?\n\nQuantified with summary statistics like the mean and median.\n\n\nsummary(pockets$minHeightFront)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Are most values very close together or far apart?\n\nQuantified with summary statistics like the variance, standard deviation, range (difference between min and max), interquartile range (IQR) (difference between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile)\nInterpretation of the variance: it is the average (roughly) squared distance of each value to the mean. Units are the squared version of the original variable.\nInterpretation of the standard deviation: square root of the variance. Measures spread on the same scale as the original variable (same units as the original variable).\n\n\nvar(pockets$minHeightFront)\n\n[1] 12.27745\n\nsd(pockets$minHeightFront)\n\n[1] 3.50392\n\n\n\nOutliers: Are there any values that are particularly high or low relative to the rest?\n\nA good paragraph putting all of these aspects together:\n\nThe distribution of the minimum height of front pockets seems right skewed with values ranging from 9.5 to 25cm. The average pocket height is about 15cm (median). Pocket heights tend to deviate from this average by about 3.5cm (SD), and there don‚Äôt seem to be extreme outliers.\n\n\nFile organization: You can download a template file to work with here.

Are most values very close together or far apart?\n\nQuantified with summary statistics like the variance, standard deviation, range (difference between min and max), interquartile range (IQR) (difference between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile)\nInterpretation of the variance: it is the average (roughly) squared distance of each value to the mean. Units are the squared version of the original variable.\nInterpretation of the standard deviation: square root of the variance. Measures spread on the same scale as the original variable (same units as the original variable).\n\n\nvar(pockets$minHeightFront)\n\n[1] 12.27745\n\nsd(pockets$minHeightFront)\n\n[1] 3.50392\n\n\n\nOutliers: Are there any values that are particularly high or low relative to the rest?\n\nA good paragraph putting all of these aspects together:\n\nThe distribution of the minimum height of front pockets seems right skewed with values ranging from 9.5 to 25cm. The average pocket height is about 15cm (median). Pocket heights tend to deviate from this average by about 3.5cm (SD), and there don‚Äôt seem to be extreme outliers.\n\n\nFile organization: You can download a template file to work with here.

    "text": "Exercise 4: Exploring themes in the letters\nThe dplyr package provides many useful functions for managing data (like creating new variables, summarizing information). The stringr package provides tools for working with strings (text). We‚Äôll use these packages to search for words in the questions in order to (roughly) identify themes/subjects.\nThe code below searches for words related to mothers, fathers, marriage, and money and combines them into a single theme variable.\n\nInside mutate() the line moms = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"mother|mama|mom\"), \"mom\", \"no mom\") creates a new variable called moms. If any of the text ‚Äúmother‚Äù, ‚Äúmama‚Äù, or ‚Äúmom‚Äù (which covers ‚Äúmommy‚Äù) is found, then the variable takes the value ‚Äúmom‚Äù. Otherwise, the variable takes the value ‚Äúno mom‚Äù.\nThe dads, marriage, and money variables are created similarly.\nThe themes = str_c(moms, dads, marriage, money, sep = \"|\") line takes the 4 created variables and combines the text of those variables separated with a |. For example, one value of the themes variable is ‚Äúmom|no_dad|no_marriage|no_money‚Äù (which contains words about moms but not dads, marriage, or money).\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nabby &lt;- abby %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        moms = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"mother|mama|mom\"), \"mom\", \"no mom\"),\n        dads = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"father|papa|dad\"), \"dad\", \"no dad\"),\n        marriage = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"marriage|marry|married\"), \"marriage\", \"no marriage\"),\n        money = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"money|finance\"), \"money\", \"no money\"),\n        themes = str_c(moms, dads, marriage, money, sep = \"|\")\n    )\n\n\nModify the code above however you wish to replace themes (e.g., replace ‚Äúmoms‚Äù with something else) or add new themes to search for. If you want to add a new subject to search for, copy and paste a line for an existing subject above the themes line, and modify the code like this:\n\nIf your subject is captured by multiple words: YOUR_SUBJECT = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"WORD1|WORD2|ETC\"), \"SUBJECT\", \"NO SUBJECT\"),\nIf your subject is captured by a single word: YOUR_SUBJECT = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"WORD\"), \"SUBJECT\", \"NO SUBJECT\"),\nTry to have no more than 6 subjects‚Äîotherwise we‚Äôll have too many themes, which will complicate exploration.\n\nThe code below makes a barplot of the themes variable using the ggplot2 visualization package. Before making the plot, make note of what you expect the plot might look like. (This might be hard‚Äìjust do your best!) Then compare to what you observe when you run the code chunk to make the plot. (Clearly defining your expectations first is good scientific practice to avoid confirmation bias.)\n\n\n# Load package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# barplot\nggplot(abby, aes(x = themes)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\nWe can follow up on the barplot with a simple numerical summary. Whereas the ggplot2 package is great for visualizations, dplyr is great for numerical summaries. The code below constructs a table of the number of questions with each theme. Make sure that these numerical summaries match up with what you saw in the barplot.\n\n\n# Construct a table of counts\nabby %&gt;% \n    count(themes)\n\n\nBefore proceeding, let‚Äôs break down the plotting code above. Run each chunk to see how the two lines of code above build up the plot in ‚Äúlayers‚Äù.

Clay identified 100 children in Auckland in their first year of school. And she observed them for an entire year.\nClay: I went into classrooms. I recorded exactly what children were saying and doing. And this gave me new insights for building, um, almost a new theory of how our children were learning to read.\nClay observed those 100 kids closely. She wanted to know: what were the good readers doing? And what were the poor readers doing that was different?\n(Music)\nShe came away from that study and subsequent research with her theory. Her basic idea was that good readers are good problem solvers. They‚Äôre like detectives, searching for clues. She wrote: ‚ÄúYou will be familiar with the old game ‚ÄòTwenty Questions.‚Äô Reading is something like that game.‚Äù According to Clay‚Äôs theory, when good readers come to a word they don‚Äôt know, they ask themselves good questions. Like, what word would make sense here? For example, if a girl in a story is getting ready to ride a horse, and she puts something on her horse that starts with an ‚Äús‚Äù‚Ä¶the word must be ‚Äúsaddle.‚Äù\nClay also noticed there are things good readers don‚Äôt do. They don‚Äôt laboriously sound out words. They don‚Äôt get stuck on the letters. She thought good readers use the letters in words as one of their clues. But she was convinced that letters are not very good clues. Not that reliable and sometimes just kind of confusing. She concluded that good readers use the letters in words in an ‚Äúincidental‚Äù way. She thought they just skim the letters to confirm they‚Äôre getting the meaning of what they‚Äôre reading. And their last resort when figuring out a word is to sound it out.",

    "text": "Bruce McCandliss‚Äôs study\nTimestamp: 38:58 - 43:24\nTranscript:\n\nBruce McCandliss did a study in 2015 to try to understand how different teaching methods affect reading development. He and his colleagues made up a new written language and brought people into their labs to learn this language. They divided their subjects into two groups. One group was taught the relationships between the symbols and sounds in this new language. The other group was told to just look at the whole words ‚Äì the clusters of unfamiliar symbols ‚Äì and try to remember them.\n(Music)\nAt first, both groups were learning.\nMcCandliss: Learning occurs in both cases. Like, people can master, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 of these words.\nIn fact, the students who were memorizing the whole words did better at first. Learning was slower for the students focusing on letter-sound relationships. But those students were soon able to read more words than the group that hadn‚Äôt been taught letters and sounds. And when Bruce and his colleagues looked at what was going on inside the brains of their study participants, they saw something interesting. People who were sounding out the words were reading differently than the other group.\nMcCandliss: By really encouraging people to think about and attend to the nuances of the print and how they relate to the pronunciation, we see this activation pattern that looks a lot like what the expert reading circuitry looks like.\nIn other words, the people who focused on letter-sound relationships increased activity in areas of the brain that are associated with skilled reading.\nPeople who were not taught to focus on letters and sounds used a different neural network to read. A network that is not as efficient or effective at helping you map written words into your memory. Other experiments ‚Äì with adults and children ‚Äì have shown similar patterns of brain activity.\n(Music)\nHow a person is taught affects what areas of the brain they use to read. And you want to use the parts of your brain that are going to be most efficient and effective at helping you map words into your memory. Because that‚Äôs how you become a good reader. You‚Äôre not using your brain power to identify the words. You‚Äôre using your brain power to understand what you‚Äôre reading. And that‚Äôs the goal. Bruce McCandliss says teaching kids that they don‚Äôt have to look carefully at words and sound them out is putting many of them at risk of never getting there. Of never becoming good readers.\nMcCandliss: I think more and more people are starting to recognize that there‚Äôs a pretty significant number of kids out there that we‚Äôre neglecting their needs. And the kids struggle and they suffer, and at times I‚Äôve run reading clinics where the kids break down like the fourth word into a reading test and start crying and telling you that they‚Äôre, they‚Äôre a defective person who is stupid and doesn‚Äôt belong in school and hates school and never wants to do anything with reading ever.\n(Music)\nWhen I first started doing all this reporting on reading a few years ago, I didn‚Äôt realize how many people have a hard time learning how to read. I think it came pretty easily to me and to my kids, and I didn‚Äôt think about it much because I didn‚Äôt have to. But according to Reid Lyon, the guy who oversaw all that reading research at the NICHD, learning to read is a formidable challenge for a lot of people. He estimates that about 60% of kids need direct and explicit instruction. If they don‚Äôt get it at school, they might get it at home. But if they don‚Äôt get it, they‚Äôre not likely to become very good readers ‚Äì or spellers. And within that sixty percent of people who need good instruction, there‚Äôs a group of people who need a lot of good instruction. Because learning to read is really, really hard for them. It‚Äôs not about intelligence. There are very, very smart people who struggle to learn how to read. But what the research shows is that nearly everyone can learn how to do it ‚Äì if they are taught.",

    "text": "Exercise 9: Lines of best fit (intuition for least squares)\nIn this activity, we‚Äôve learned how to fit straight lines to data, to help us visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables. So far, ggplot has chosen the line for us. How does it know which line is ‚Äúbest‚Äù, and what does ‚Äúbest‚Äù even mean?\nFor this exercise, we‚Äôll consider the relationship between x1 and y1 in the anscombe dataset. Run the following code, which creates a scatterplot with a fitted line to our data using the function geom_abline:\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_abline(slope = 0.4, intercept = 3, col = \"blue\", size = 1)\n\nDescribe the line that you see. Do you think the line is ‚Äúgood‚Äù? What are you using to define ‚Äúgood‚Äù?\nSome things to think about:\n\nHow many points are above the line?\nHow many points are below the line?\nAre the distances of the points above and below the line roughly similar, or is there meaningful difference?\n\nNow we‚Äôll add another line to our plot. Which line do you think is better suited for this data? Why? Be specific!\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_abline(slope = 0.4, intercept = 3, col = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n    geom_abline(slope = 0.5, intercept = 4, col = \"orange\", size = 1)\n\nIt‚Äôs usually quite simple to note when a line is bad, but more difficult to quantify when a line is a good fit for our data. Consider the following line:\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_abline(slope = -0.5, intercept = 10, col = \"red\", size = 1) \n\nIn the next activity, we‚Äôll formalize the principle of least squares, which will give us one particular definition of a line of best fit that is commonly used in statistics! We‚Äôll take advantage of the vertical distances between each point and the fitted line (residuals), which will help us define (mathematically) a line that best fits our data:\n\n# Before you run this code chunk, you will need to enter \n# the following command in the Console:\n# install.packages(\"broom\")\nlibrary(broom)\nmod &lt;- lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe)\n\naugment(mod) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    geom_segment(aes(xend = x1, yend = .fitted), col = \"red\") +\n    geom_point()",

Although the first two checkpoints will not directly contribute to your course grade, the feedback you receive on them will help you make an excellent final paper.\n\n\nResources\nLater in the semester, I will post at least one example of a successful final paper, as well as a Google Doc template for the final paper.\n\n\nProject Groups\nProject groups will ultimately be determined by me, with the assistance of a Project Group Preferences survey. The survey will be sent out early in the semester (exact date TBD) and will allow you to either list people you would like to be in a group with or specify that you would like to be placed in a group randomly by me. I will do my best to ensure that groups are constructed as closely to survey responses as possible. Since one component of the project involves an in-class presentation, you may not work with students in different sections on the project.\nIf for any reason there is an individual (or individuals) with whom you do not feel safe participating in a project group with, there will be a space to note this on the survey. You will not be expected to provide any justification for your response to this question, but note that as I need to place you in groups, the survey will not be anonymous.\nGroup work and collaboration are important components of nearly all statistical analyses and projects. I recognize that individual contributions to a group project are not always consistent between group members. To this end, you will (as a group) be expected to explicitly specify the project tasks completed by each team member along with the final draft of your paper.\nIf there are any concerns with project groups throughout the semester, I am happy to meet with groups or individuals to discuss ways to move forward."
