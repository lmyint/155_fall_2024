    "text": "Hello, and welcome to a new year at Macalester! I‚Äôm excited to spend the next 15 weeks with you journeying through a beloved field of mine.\nI will confess that early during college, I really didn‚Äôt love statistics. In my first statistics class, we focused almost entirely on formulas and procedures, and I was continually left wondering: ‚ÄúWhy should I care??‚Äù Still, I decided to give statistics another try, and the next year I had the fortune of taking a statistics class that really emphasized the connection between math and data. I began to see and imagine possibilities for collecting data in fields that could improve people‚Äôs lives, and I found this incredibly inspiring.\nIn graduate school, I quickly saw how much other disciplines use and benefit from statistics, and my admiration for the field deepened immensely. I‚Äôve had the chance to use statistics to learn about many interesting areas including biology, epidemiology, public health, and even my own hobbies! Over the years, my students have used data to learn about redlining, renewable energy, cinema, sports, ecology, and so much more.\nI love teaching introductory statistics, and I can‚Äôt wait to show you all the tools and ideas statistics has to offer. I‚Äôm also excited to find ways for you to connect to data and statistics in your own lives.\nLet‚Äôs have a great semester!"

    "text": "My philosophy\nGrading is thorny issue for many educators because of its known negative effects on learning and motivation. Nonetheless, it is ever-present in the US education system and at Macalester. Because I am required to submit grades for this course, it‚Äôs worth me taking a minute to share my philosophy about grading with you.\nWhat excites me about being a teacher is your learning.\nLearning flourishes in an environment where you find meaning and value in what we‚Äôre exploring, feel supported when engaging with challenges, receive useful feedback, and regularly reflect on your learning.\nIf I didn‚Äôt have to give grades, I wouldn‚Äôt. But because I am required to, it is important to me to create a course structure and grading system that allow learning to flourish:\n\nFinding meaning and value: I am striving to achieve this by creating space for authentic connection between you, your peers, and myself and by encouraging you to explore a topic that intrigues you for our course project.\nSupport in engaging with challenges: The assignments and activities that we will use to learn are meant to be challenging, and perfect understanding on your first try is not my expectation. For this reason, there will be opportunities to show improvement in your understanding over time to improve your grade on past assignments and assessments. Strong learning does not occur under excessive stress, so my hope is that having multiple chances to show your understanding alleviates much of the stress that would normally arise from needing to do as well as possible with only one try.\nReceiving useful feedback and reflecting regularly: My aim with feedback is to always provide guidance towards improvement, no matter where you are in your progress. However, good feedback alone is useless‚Äîlearners need to engage deeply with feedback in order to benefit the most from it. For this reason, opportunities to improve your scores on prior assignments will require reflecting on feedback."

For example, if your first attempt on a 1-point question is incorrect, the maximum possible score on that question is 0.67 points for the second attempt. On the third attempt, the maximum score is 0.33 points. No points are awarded for the 4th attempt and beyond.\n\n\nPractice problems\nTo practice concepts that we cover in class, there will be 8 weekly practice problems (PPs) due on Fridays at 5pm. (Note that if needed, extensions are possible‚Äîsee the late work policy.)\nYou will receive qualitative feedback on all questions on these practice problem sets. These assignments will receive on overall score on the following scale:\n\nHigh pass: 2 points\nPass: 1 point\nNeeds improvement: 0 points\n\nShowing growth: If, on a quiz, you demonstrate stronger understanding of the concepts that you missed on a PP, you have the chance to earn a higher score on the PP. Either via email or through an in-person conversation with the instructor, you must discuss how your understanding of the concept(s) changed from the PP to the quiz by addressing feedback from both the PP and the quiz. You can do this 2 times over the semester (once for Quizzes 1 and 2), and you can show improvement on multiple PPs using a single quiz.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be 3 quizzes over the course of the semester.\n\nQuiz 1: Friday, 9/27. 1 hour in class.\nQuiz 2: Friday, 11/1. 1 hour in class. Will cover material from the first quiz to some extent because of the way that material in this course builds on earlier ideas.\nQuiz 3: Monday, 12/16 8:00-10:00am. ~1.25 hours during our final exam slot. Will cover content from the whole course.\n\nEach quiz question will be graded on the following scale:\n\n3 points: fully correct\n2 points: mostly correct with minor errors\n1 point: missing key understanding\n0 points: fully off target or blank\n\nQuiz format:\n\nFully pen/pencil and paper. You will not need to write code or use a calculator, but you will need to be able to read and interpret output from R code.\nYou are allowed to bring a 3x5 index card with notes written on both sides. Typing your notes and pasting them on the card is fine.\n\nShowing growth: For Quizzes 1 and 2, you can earn up to 50% of missed points back on quizzes if you complete a quiz correction and reflection. You must:\n\nWrite a reflection of how you prepared for the quiz and where you felt strongest and more uncertain in your understanding before taking the quiz\nSchedule a meeting with the instructor. During our conversation, you will correct your quiz responses and discuss the above reflection. You will get immediate feedback at this meeting. Use my Calendly page to schedule this meeting.\n\n\n\nProject\nThe goal of the course project is to apply the data analysis skills from our course to investigate a research question in a dataset of your choosing. Through milestones over the course of the semester, you will make steady progress on your projects and iterate on feedback. Full details about the project will be available on the Project page."

Although the first two checkpoints will not directly contribute to your course grade, the feedback you receive on them will help you make an excellent final paper.\n\n\nResources\nLater in the semester, I will post at least one example of a successful final paper, as well as a Google Doc template for the final paper.\n\n\nProject Groups\nProject groups will ultimately be determined by me, with the assistance of a Project Group Preferences survey. The survey will be sent out early in the semester (exact date TBD) and will allow you to either list people you would like to be in a group with or specify that you would like to be placed in a group randomly by me. I will do my best to ensure that groups are constructed as closely to survey responses as possible. Since one component of the project involves an in-class presentation, you may not work with students in different sections on the project.\nIf for any reason there is an individual (or individuals) with whom you do not feel safe participating in a project group with, there will be a space to note this on the survey. You will not be expected to provide any justification for your response to this question, but note that as I need to place you in groups, the survey will not be anonymous.\nGroup work and collaboration are important components of nearly all statistical analyses and projects. I recognize that individual contributions to a group project are not always consistent between group members. To this end, you will (as a group) be expected to explicitly specify the project tasks completed by each team member along with the final draft of your paper.\nIf there are any concerns with project groups throughout the semester, I am happy to meet with groups or individuals to discuss ways to move forward."
