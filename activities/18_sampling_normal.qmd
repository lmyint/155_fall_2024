# Notes

- You can download a template file to work with [here](../activity_templates/18_sampling_normal.qmd).
- **File organization:** Save this file in the "Activities" subfolder of your "STAT155" folder.

## Learning goals

- Recognize the difference between a **population parameter** and a **sample estimate**.
- Review the Normal probability model, a tool we'll need to turn information in our **sample data** into **inferences** about the broader **population**.
- Explore the *ideas* of randomness, sampling distributions, and standard error through a class experiment. (We'll define these more formally in the next class.)


## Readings and videos

Before class you should have read and watched:

- Reading: Section 6 Introduction, and Section 6.6 in the [STAT 155 Notes](https://mac-stat.github.io/Stat155Notes/)
- Video 1: [exploration vs inference](https://youtu.be/_KfOoWQygPk)

# Exercises: Normal distribution

Let's practice some Normal model concepts.

First, run the following chunk which defines a `shaded_normal()` **function** which is specialized to this activity alone:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

shaded_normal <- function(mean, sd, a = NULL, b = NULL){
  min_x <- mean - 4*sd
  max_x <- mean + 4*sd
  a <- max(a, min_x)
  b <- min(b, max_x)
  ggplot() + 
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min_x, max_x), breaks = c(mean - sd*(0:3), mean + sd*(1:3))) +
    stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) + 
    stat_function(geom = "area", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd), xlim = c(a, b), fill = "blue") + 
    labs(y = "density") + 
    theme_minimal()
}
```


## Exercise 1: Using the Normal model

Suppose that the speeds of cars on a highway, in miles per hour, can be reasonably represented by the Normal model with a *mean* of 55mph and a *standard deviation* of 5mph from car to car:

$$
X \sim N(55, 5^2)
$$

```{r eval=FALSE}
shaded_normal(mean = 55, sd = 5)
```



a. Provide the (approximate) range of the middle 68% of speeds, and shade in the corresponding region on your Normal curve. NOTE: `a` is the lower end of the range and `b` is the upper end.    

```{r eval=FALSE}
shaded_normal(mean = 55, sd = 5, a = ___, b = ___)
```
    
    
    
b. Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to estimate the probability that a car's speed exceeds 60mph.  

> Your response here

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Visualize
shaded_normal(mean = 55, sd = 5, a = 60)
```    


c. Which of the following is the correct *range* for the probability that a car's speed exceeds 67mph? Explain your reasoning.

* less than 0.0015
* between 0.0015 and 0.025
* between 0.025 and 0.16
* greater than 0.16

> Explain your reasoning here

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Visualize
shaded_normal(mean = 55, sd = 5, a = 67)
```





## Exercise 2: Z-scores

Inherently important to all of our calculations above is *how many standard deviations a value "X" is from the mean*.

This distance is called a **Z-score** and can be calculated as follows:    
    
$$
\text{Z-score} = \frac{X - \text{mean}}{\text{sd}}
$$
  

For example (from Exercise 1), if I'm traveling 40 miles an hour, my Z-score is -3. That is, my speed is 3 standard deviations *below* the average speed:    
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
(40 - 55) / 5
```

a. Consider 2 other drivers. Both drivers are speeding. Who do you think is speeding *more*, relative to the distributions of speed in their area?  

    - Driver A is traveling at 60mph on the highway where speeds are N(55, 5^2) and the speed limit is 55mph.
    - Driver B is traveling at 36mph on a residential road where speeds are N(30, 3^2) and the speed limit is 30mph.
    
> Put your best guess (hypothesis) here

b. Calculate the Z-scores for Drivers A and B.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Driver A


# Driver B


```

c. Now, based on the Z-scores, who is speeding more? NOTE: The below plots might provide some insights.   

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Driver A
shaded_normal(mean = 55, sd = 5) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 60)

# Driver B
shaded_normal(mean = 30, sd = 3) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 36)  
```

# Exercises: Sampling variation

The below exercises require 2 new packages.
Type the following into your **console** to install them:

- install.packages("gsheet")
- install.packages("usdata")

The `county_complete` data in the `usdata` package includes demographic data on 3142 U.S. counties.
(Image: [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_USA_with_county_outlines_(black_%26_white).png)) 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Map_of_USA_with_county_outlines_%28black_%26_white%29.png)


Our goal will be to model the relationship between the per capita income in 2019 and 2017 (in $1000s) among U.S. counties:

```{r}
# Load the data & handy packages
library(dplyr)
library(usdata)
data(county_complete)

# Wrangle the data
county_clean <- county_complete %>% 
  mutate(pci_2019 = per_capita_income_2019 / 1000, 
         pci_2017 = per_capita_income_2017 / 1000) %>% 
  select(state, name, fips, pci_2019, pci_2017)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Plot the relationship
county_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = pci_2019, x = pci_2017)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

# Model the relationship
pop_model <- lm(pci_2019 ~ pci_2017, data = county_clean)
coef(summary(pop_model))
```



## Exercise 3: Parameter vs estimate

The `Intercept` and `pci_2017` coefficients are **population parameters**. 

In order to conduct statistical inference, we typically assume that there is some *true*, underlying, fixed intercept and slope $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, that describe the true linear relationship in the overall population that we're interested in. In this case, the population some process underlying per capita income is U.S. counties.

The true underlying model we assume is thus:

$$
E[pci\_2019 \mid pci\_2017] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 pci\_2017
$$

We typically don't have access to our entire population of interest, even at a fixed time point. In this scenario, however, we *do* have access to our **finite population parameters** at this time, since we have data from every county! These are **estimates** of the true, population parameters from our underlying, generative process. Our statistical model provides us with **estimates** of these parameters:

$$
E[pci\_2019 \mid pci\_2017] = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 pci\_2017
$$
where our estimates are given by our model as $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1.294$, $\hat{\beta}_1 = 1.027$




Below, we'll *simulate* the concept of random sampling, from the data that we have. You'll each take a random sample of 10 U.S. counties, and we'll see if we can recover the observed, finite population parameters from the whole dataset containing information from every county.

First, fill in your intuition below:

- Do you think every student will get the same set of 10 counties?

> Your response here

- Do you think that *your* coefficient estimates will be the same as your neighbors'?

> Your responses here




## Exercise 4: Random sampling

a. Use the `sample_n()` function to take a *random sample* of 2 counties.   

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Try running the following chunk A FEW TIMES
sample_n(county_clean, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
```

Reflect: 
 
- How do your results compare to your neighbors'?

> Your response here

- What is the role of `size = 2`? *HINT*: Remember you can look at function documentation by running `?sample_n` in the console!

> Your response here

- What is the role of `replace = FALSE`? *HINT*: Remember you can look at function documentation by running `?sample_n` in the console!

> Your response here



b. Now, "set the seed" to 155 and re-try your sampling. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Try running the following FULL chunk A FEW TIMES
set.seed(155)
sample_n(county_clean, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
```


What changed?

> Your response here





## Exercise 5: Take your own sample

The underlying *random number generator* plays a role in the random sample we happen to get.
If we `set.seed(some positive integer)` before taking a random sample, we'll get the same results.

This **reproducibility** is important:    
    
- we get the same results every time we render our qmd

- we can share our work with others & ensure they get our same answers

- it wouldn't be great if you submitted your work to, say, a journal and weren't able to back up / confirm / reproduce your results!    




Follow the chunks below to obtain and use your *own* unique sample.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# DON'T SKIP THIS STEP! 
# Set the random number seed to your own phone number (just the numbers)
set.seed(___)

# Take a sample of 10 counties
my_sample <- sample_n(county_clean, size = 10, replace = FALSE)
my_sample                       
```    

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Plot the relationship of pci_2019 with pci_2017 among your sample
my_sample %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = pci_2019, x = pci_2017)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Model the relationship among your sample
my_model <- lm(pci_2019 ~ pci_2017, data = my_sample)
coef(summary(my_model))
```



**REPORT YOUR WORK**

Indicate your intercept and slope *sample estimates* in [this survey](https://forms.gle/UScGPwN3zCYshwih6).










## Exercise 6: Sampling variation

Recall the estimates of the **population parameters**, at this fixed point in time, describing the relationship between `pci_2019` and `pci_2017`:

$$
E[pci\_2019 \mid pic\_2017] = 1.294 + 1.027 pci\_2017
$$

Let's explore how our **sample estimates** of these parameters *varied* from student to student:


```{r}
# Import the experiment results
library(gsheet)
results <- gsheet2tbl('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11OT1VnLTTJasp5BHSKulgJiCbSLiutv8mKDOfvvXZSo/edit?usp=sharing')
```

    
Plot each student's *sample estimate* of the model line (gray).
How do these compare to the *population* model (red)?    

```{r eval=FALSE}
county_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = pci_2019, x = pci_2017)) +
  geom_abline(data = results, aes(intercept = sample_intercept, slope = sample_slope), color = "gray") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE)
```
    







## Exercise 7: Sample intercepts

Let's focus on just the *sample estimates* of the *intercept* parameter:

```{r eval=FALSE}
results %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sample_intercept)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.294, color = "red")
```    


Comment on the shape, center, and spread of these sample estimates and how they relate to the *actual* population intercept (red).

> Your response here







## Exercise 8: Slopes

Suppose we were to construct a density plot of the sample estimates of the `pci_2017` coefficient (slope) .

a. *Intuitively*, what *shape* do you think this plot will have?

> Your response here

b. *Intuitively*, around what value do you think this plot will be *centered*?

> Your response here

c. Check your intuition:        

```{r eval=FALSE}
results %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sample_slope)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.027, color = "red")
```    


d. Thinking back to the 68-95-99.7 rule, visually approximate the *standard deviation* among the sample slopes.

> Your response here





## Exercise 9: Standard error

You've likely observed that the *typical* or mean slope estimate is roughly equal to the actual population slope parameter, 1.027:

```{r eval=FALSE}
results %>% 
  summarize(mean(sample_slope))
```

Thus the *standard deviation* of the slope estimates measures how *far* we might expect an estimate to fall from the actual population slope.

That is, it measures the typical or **standard error** in our sample estimates:

```{r eval=FALSE}
results %>% 
  summarize(sd(sample_slope))
```

a. Recall *your* sample estimate of the slope. How far is it from the population slope, 1.027?
    
```{r eval=FALSE}

```



b. How many *standard errors* does your estimate fall from the population slope? That is, what's your **Z-score**?        

```{r}

```
    

c. Reflecting upon your Z-score, do you think your sample estimate was one of the "lucky" ones, or one of the "unlucky" ones?

## Exercise 3: Parameter vs estimate

intuition



## Exercise 4: Random sampling

```{r}
# Observe that the 2 counties change every time & differ from your neighbors' samples
sample_n(county_clean, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Observe that the 2 counties are the same every time & are the same as your neighbors' samples
set.seed(155)
sample_n(county_clean, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
```






## Exercise 5: Take your own sample
    
will vary from student to student







## Exercise 6: Sampling variation

The sample estimates *vary* around the population model:

```{r}
# Import the experiment results
library(gsheet)
results <- gsheet2tbl('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11OT1VnLTTJasp5BHSKulgJiCbSLiutv8mKDOfvvXZSo/edit?usp=sharing')

county_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = pci_2019, x = pci_2017)) +
  geom_abline(data = results, aes(intercept = sample_intercept, slope = sample_slope), color = "gray") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE)
```
    






## Exercise 7: Sample intercepts


The intercepts are roughly normal, centered around the population intercept (1.294), and range from roughly `r round(quantile(results$sample_intercept, 0.025), 3)` to `r round(quantile(results$sample_intercept, 0.975), 3)`:

```{r}
results %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sample_intercept)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.294, color = "red")
```    









## Exercise 8: Slopes

a. intuition
b. intuition
c. Check your intuition:        

```{r}
results %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sample_slope)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.027, color = "red")
```    

d. Will vary, but should roughly be `r round(sd(results$sample_slope), 2)`.






## Exercise 9: Standard error

a. For example, suppose my estimate were 1.1:
    
```{r}
1.1 - 1.027
```



b. For example, suppose my estimate were 1.1. Then my Z-score is (1.1 - 1.027) / `r round(sd(results$sample_slope), 2)` = `r (1.1 - 1.027) / round(sd(results$sample_slope), 2)`
    

c. This is somewhat subjective. But we'll learn that if your estimate is within 2 sd of the actual slope, i.e. your Z-score is between -2 and 2, you're pretty "lucky".
