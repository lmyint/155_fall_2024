## Learning goals

Working with multiple predictors in our plots and models can get complicated! There are no *recipes* for this process, but there are some guiding *principles* that assist in long-term retention, deeper understanding, and the ability to generalize our tools in new settings.

By the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with some general *principles* for... 

- incorporating additional quantitative or categorical predictors in a visualization
- how additional quantitative or categorical predictors impact the physical representation of a model
- interpreting quantitative or categorical coefficients in a multiple regression model





## Readings and videos

Before class you should have watched the following video:

- [Interpreting multivariate models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnXwu1OWgMM) ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fiJL1IbReg6RJmjxRideYzYTyQtWR3Or/view?usp=sharing))





# Exercises

Let's revisit the bikeshare data:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load packages & import data
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

bikes <- read_csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/bikeshare.csv") %>% 
    rename(rides = riders_registered)
```

Our goal is to understand how / why registered ridership from day to day.
To this end, we'll build various **multiple linear regression** models of `rides` by different combinations of the possible predictors:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Check out the data
head(bikes)
```




## Exercise 1: Review visualization

Let's prepare to build a model of `rides` by `windspeed` (quantitative) and `weekend` status (categorical) by construcing a visualization of the relationship between these 3 variables.

Include linear smoothing lines so that we can see a representation of the regression model that we'll build in the next exercise.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Plot of rides vs windspeed & weekend
# HINT: Start with a plot of rides vs windspeed

```




## Exercise 2: Review model

Let's build the model:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bike_model_1 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + weekend, data = bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_1))
```

The model formula thus is:

E[rides | windspeed, weekendTRUE] = 4738.38 - 63.97 * windspeed - 925.16 * weekendTRUE

This model formula is represented by 2 lines, one corresponding to weekends and the other to weekdays. Specify the corresponding sub-model formulas:       
    
weekdays: rides = ___ - ___ windspeed   

weekends: rides = ___ - ___ windspeed








## Exercise 3: Review coefficient interpretation


a. The intercept coefficient, 4738.38, represents the *intercept* of the sub-model for weekdays, the reference category. What's its *contextual* interpretation?
    

b. The `windspeed` coefficient, -63.97, represents the *shared slope* of the weekend and weekday sub-models. What's its *contextual* interpretation?
    

c. The `weekendTRUE` coefficient, -925.16, represents the *change in intercept* for the weekend vs weekday sub-model. What's its *contextual* interpretation?








## Exercise 4: 2 categorical predictors -- visualization

Thus far, we've explored a couple examples of multiple regression models that have 2 predictors, 1 quantitative and 1 categorical.

So what happens when *both* predictors are categorical?!

To this end, let's model `rides` by `weekend` status and `season`.

The below code plots `rides` vs `season`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# rides vs season
bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = season)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
```

Modify this code to *also* include information about `weekend`. (Hint: Remember the visualization *principle* that additional categorical predictors require some sort of grouping mechanism / mechanism that distinguishes between the 2 groups.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
# rides vs season AND weekend
bikes %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = season, ___ = ___)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```





## Exercise 5: follow-up

a. Describe (in words) the relationship of ridership with season and weekend status.



b. A model of `rides` by `season` alone would be represented by only 4 expected outcomes, 1 for each season. Considering this and the plot above, how do you *anticipate* a model of `rides` by `season` and `weekend` status will be represented?        
    - 2 lines, 1 for each weekend status
    - 8 lines, 1 for each possible combination of season and weekend
    - 2 expected outcomes, 1 for each weekend status
    - 8 expected outcomes, 1 for each possible combination of season and weekend
    




## Exercise 6: 2 categorical predictors -- build the model

Let's build the multiple regression model of `rides` vs `season` and `weekend`:
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
bike_model_2 <- lm(rides ~ weekend + season, bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_2))
```

Thus the model formula is

E[rides | weekend, season] = 4260.45 - 912.33 weekendTRUE - 116.38 seasonspring + 438.44 seasonsummer - 1719.06 seasonwinter

a. Use this model to predict the ridership on the following days:    
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
# a fall weekday
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a winter weekday    
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a fall weekend day        
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a winter weekend day
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___
```



b. We only made 4 predictions here. How many *possible* predictions does this model produce? Is this consistent with your intuition in the previous exercise?








## Exercise 7: 2 categorical predictors -- interpret the model

Use your above predictions and visualization to fill in the below interpretations of the model coefficients.

Hint: What is the consequence of plugging in 0 or 1 for the different `weekend` and `season` categories?    

a. Interpreting 4260: We expect there to be 4260 riders on (weekdays/weekends) during the (fall/spring/summer/winter).    

b. Interpreting -912: *In any season*, we expect there to be 912 (more/fewer) riders on weekends than on ___.

c. Interpreting -1719: *On both weekdays and weekends*, we expect there to be 1719 (more/fewer) riders in winter than in ___.









## Exercise 8: 2 quantitative predictors -- visualization   

Next, consider the relationship between `rides` and 2 *quantitative* predictors: `windspeed` and `temp_feel`.

Check out 2 plots of this relationship below.

These reflect the visualization *principle* that quantitative variables require some sort of numerical scaling mechanism -- `rides` and `windspeed` get numerical axes, and `temp_feel` gets size and color scales.

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/155/bikes_multivar_3.png)

Modify the code below to recreate these 2 plots.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Left plot
bikes %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, ___ = ___)) +
    geom_point()

# Right plot
bikes %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, ___ = ___)) +
    geom_point()
```


With some new code in the `plotly` (not `ggplot2`) package, we can also plot these 3 quantitative variables in 3D, each getting their own axis!

First, enter `install.packages("plotly")` in the *console* (not Rmd).

Then play around with this code:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)

plot_ly(data = bikes,
        z = ~rides, y = ~windspeed, x = ~temp_feel, 
        type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", size = 0.5)
```









## Exercise 9: follow-up

a. Describe (in words) the relationship of ridership with windspeed & temperature.



b. A model of `rides` by `windspeed` alone would be represented by 1 line. How do you *anticipate* a model of `rides` by `windspeed` and `temp_feel` status will be represented? HINT: Think about the 3D scatterplot.
    






## Exercise 10: 2 quantitative predictors -- modeling

Let's build the multiple regression model of `rides` vs `windspeed` and `temp_feel`:
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
bike_model_3 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + temp_feel, bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_3))
```

Thus the model formula is    

E[rides | windspeed, temp_feel] = -24.06 - 36.54 windspeed + 55.52 temp_feel

This is the formula of a *plane*, drawn here:

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/155/ridesVwindVtemp.png)


a. Interpret the intercept coefficient, -24.06, in context.



b. Interpret the `windspeed` coefficient, -36.54, in context. HINT: This is the slope of the red lines in the *right* plot, drawn at 3 arbitrary temperatures (40, 60, and 90 degrees).


c. Interpret the `temp_feel` coefficient, 55.52, in context. HINT: This is the slope of the red lines in the left plot, drawn at 3 arbitrary wind speeds (5, 20, and 30 mph).



    
      
    
    



## Exercise 11: Which is best?

We've now observed 3 different models of ridership, each having 2 predictors.
The R-squared values of these models, along with those of the simple linear regression models with each predictor alone, are summarized below.
    
model                     predictors                R-squared
------------------------- ------------------------- ------------
`bike_model_1`            `windspeed` & `weekend`   0.119
`bike_model_2`            `weekend` & `season`      0.349
`bike_model_3`            `windspeed` & `temp_feel` 0.310
`bike_model_4`            `windspeed`               0.047
`bike_model_5`            `temp_feel`               0.296
`bike_model_6`            `weekend`                 0.074
`bike_model_7`            `season`                  0.279


a. Which model does the best job of explaining the variability in ridership from day to day?


b. If you could only pick one predictor, which would it be?


c. What happens to R-squared when we add a second predictor to our model, and why does this make sense? For example, how does the R-squared for model 1 (with both windspeed and weekend) compare to those of model 4 (only windspeed) and model 6 (only weekend)?


d. Are 2 predictors always better than 1? Provide evidence and explain why this makes sense.

## Exercise 12: Principles of interpretation

These exercises have revealed some **principles** behind interpreting model coefficients, summarized below.

Review and confirm that these make sense.

---

**Principles of interpretation**

Consider a multiple linear regression model:

$$E[y | x_1, x_2, ..., x_p] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p$$

We can interpret the coefficients as follows:    

- $\beta_0$ ("beta 0") is the y-intercept. It describes the typical value of $y$ when $x_1, x_2,..., x_k$ are all 0, ie. when all quantitative predictors are set to 0 and the categorical predictors are set to their reference levels.    

- $\beta_i$ ("beta i") is the coefficient of $x_i$.    

    - If $x_i$ is quantitative, $\beta_i$ describes the typical change in $y$ per 1-unit increase in $x_i$ while at a fixed set of the other $x$.    
    - If $x_i$ represents a category of a categorical variable, $\beta_i$ describes the typical change in $y$ when we move to this category from the reference category while at a fixed set of the other $x$.

# Solutions


## Exercise 1: Review visualization

```{r}
bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, color = weekend)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


## Exercise 2: Review model

```{r}
bike_model_1 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + weekend, data = bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_1))
```

weekdays: rides = 4738.38 - 63.97 windspeed    

weekends: rides = 4738.38 - 63.97 windspeed - 925.16 = 3813.22 - 63.97 windspeed


## Exercise 3: Review coefficient interpretation

a. We expect roughly 4738 riders on **weekdays with 0 windspeed**.

b. On both weekends and weekdays, we expect 64 fewer riders for every 1mph increase in windspeed.

c. At any windspeed, we expect 925 *fewer* riders on weekend days than on weekdays.




## Exercise 4: 2 categorical predictors – visualization


```{r}
bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = season, fill = weekend)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
```




## Exercise 5: follow-up

a. In every season, ridership tends to be lower on weekends. Across weekend status, ridership tends to be highest in summer and lowest in winter.

b. 8 expected outcomes



## Exercise 6: 2 categorical predictors – build the model

```{r}
bike_model_2 <- lm(rides ~ weekend + season, bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_2))
```

a.

```{r}
#fall weekday:    
4260.45 - 912.33*0 - 116.38*0 + 438.44*0 - 1719.06*0

#winter weekday:
4260.45 - 912.33*0 - 116.38*0 + 438.44*0 - 1719.06*1

#fall weekend:    
4260.45 - 912.33*1 - 116.38*0 + 438.44*0 - 1719.06*0

#winter weekend:
4260.45 - 912.33*1 - 116.38*0 + 438.44*0 - 1719.06*1
```

b. 8: 2 weekend categories * 4 season categories    


## Exercise 7: 2 categorical predictors – interpret the model


a. We expect there to be 4260 riders on **weekdays** during the **fall**.
b. *In any season*, we expect there to be 912 **fewer** riders on weekends than on **weekdays**.
c. *On both weekdays and weekends*, we expect there to be 1719 **fewer** riders in winter than in **fall**.



## Exercise 8: 2 quantitative predictors – visualization


```{r}
bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, size = temp_feel)) + 
    geom_point() 

bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, color = temp_feel)) + 
    geom_point() 
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)

plot_ly(data = bikes,
        z = ~rides, y = ~windspeed, x = ~temp_feel, 
        type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", size = 0.5)
```




## Exercise 9: follow-up

Ridership tends to increase with temperature (no matter the windspeed) and decrease with windspeed (no matter the temperature).



## Exercise 10: 2 quantitative predictors – modeling

```{r}
bike_model_3 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + temp_feel, bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_3))
```

a. -24.06 = typical ridership on days with 0 windspeed and a 0 degree temperature. (This doesn't make contextual sense, but indicates where the plane "lives" in space!)

b. No matter the temperature, we expect 37 fewer riders for every 1mph increase in windspeed.

c. No matter the windspeed, we expect 56 more riders for every 1 degree increase in temperature.




## Exercise 11: Which is best?

a. model 2
b. temperature
c. R-squared increases (our model is stronger when we include another predictor)
d. nope. model 1 (with windspeed and weekend) has a lower R-squared than model 5 (with only temperature)
    

\
\


## Exercise 13: Practice 1    

```{r}
bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = weekend, fill = weather_cat)) + 
    geom_boxplot()

new_model_1 <- lm(rides ~ weekend + weather_cat, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_1))
```



- The typical ridership on a *weekday* with *nice* weather (categ1) is 4212 rides.    

- On days with similar weather, the typical ridership on a *weekend* is 982 rides less than on weekdays.    

- On similar days of the week, the typical ridership when the weather is "dreary" (categ2) is 609 rides less than when the weather is nice.    



\
\




## Exercise 14: Practice 2    
    
```{r}
ggplot(bikes, aes(y = rides, x = temp_feel, color = humidity)) + 
        geom_point()

new_model_2 <- lm(rides ~ temp_feel + humidity, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_2))
```

- It doesn't really make sense to interpret the intercept -- we didn't see any days that were 0 degrees with 0 humidity.    

- On days with similar humidity, the typical ridership increases by 60 rides for each 1 degree increase in temperature.    

- On days with similar temperature, the typical ridership decreases by 1867 * 0.1 = 187 rides for each 0.1 increase in humidity levels.    



\
\




## Exercise 15: Practice 3

```{r}
new_model_3 <- lm(rides ~ temp_feel + weather_cat, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_3))

bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = temp_feel, color = weather_cat)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line(aes(y = new_model_3$fitted.values), size = 1.5)
```

- It doesn't really make sense to interpret the intercept -- we didn't see any days that were 0 degrees.    

- On days with similar weather, the typical ridership increases by 55 rides for each 1 degree increase in temperature.    

- On days with similar temperature, the typical ridership is 386 rides lower on a dreary weather day (categ2) than a nice weather day (categ1).  


## Exercise 16: CHALLENGE

   
```{r}
bikes %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = temp_feel, color = weekend, size = humidity)) + 
    geom_point()

new_model_4 <- lm(rides ~ temp_feel + humidity + weekend, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_4))
```

- It doesn't really make sense to interpret the intercept -- we didn't see any days that were 0 degrees.    
- On days with similar humidity and time of week, the typical ridership increases by 59 rides for each 1 degree increase in temperature.    
- On days with similar temperature and time of week, the typical ridership decreases by 1906*0.1 = 190.6 rides for each 0.1 point increase in humidity levels.         
- On days with similar temperature and humidity, the typical ridership is 869 rides lower on weekends vs weekdays. 


This model would look like 2 parallel planes, one for weekends and one for weekdays! Why?  `rides` vs `temp_feel` (quant) would be a line. Adding in `humidity` (quant) would turn the model into a plane. Adding in `weekend` (cat) would split this one plane into two unique planes, one for each weekend category!
